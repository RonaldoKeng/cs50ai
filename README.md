👋 Heyo! I took CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python over 2021. You can view the course outline here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/

🧑‍💻 Here are the list of projects I implemented for the course. You may find some of them interesting conceptually. You can view each project's specifications here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects

👇 After completing all of the projects + quizzes, you'll get something that looks like this!

🚨 Please note some large databases are omitted, specifically from the projects degrees and traffic. GitHub repo upload size is limited to 25Mb. These data can be downloaded from the project specifications if you're interested to see how they run.

🙌 If you wanna learn more about any of the projects or the course in general, reach out and let's chat!
