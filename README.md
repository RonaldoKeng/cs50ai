# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

👋 Heyo! I took CS50's AI course over 2021, produced by the legendary staff at Harvard CS50. I highly recommend any courses from CS50 but this one was particularly enjoyable.

"This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own."

🧑‍💻 In this repo, you'll find my implementation for the projects in this course. I hope you find some of them interesting conceptually! You can view each project's specifications here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects

👇 After completing all of the projects + quizzes, you'll get something that looks like this!

🚨 Please note some large databases are omitted, specifically from the projects degrees and traffic. GitHub repo upload size is limited to 25Mb. These data can be downloaded from the project specifications if you're interested to see how they run.
